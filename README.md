# Boilerplate for TypeScript

Boilerplate for TypeScript projects with linter, build, tests

Best practices of TypeScript development:

1. JSDoc declaration -> Interface/Type declaration + validation
2. Guard if checks -> less
3. TSLint + Linting under hood in TypeScript
4. Compilation stage
5. Custom errors
6. Tests + coverage -> less because of less ifs
7. NPM scripts
